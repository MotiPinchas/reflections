How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I actually saw the difference in a graphical way. I saw the previous version 
    and it helped me to understand what is the right world that should be there.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    When you have the access to the history of a file you can easily check the
    difference and go straight to the place you want to change.
   

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: In annual mode you have the ability to decide the exact time of the version.
    cons: You need to always remember that you need to create a commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is especially for programmers, as a programmer you need to change a few 
    file together . Sometimes there are few programers working together on the same
    project, and to gather all the code together you need a snapshot of every one of
    them. Google docs is something more personaly. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Its simple: 1. need to write “git log” command to get the all commits and its dates.
    	        2. need to write “git diff FIRS_COMMIT_ID SECOND_COMMIT_ID” command to 
		   get the actual changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Now i cab be sure that my previous work won’t be deleted and i can always go back 
    to the point where it was worked.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try working with a hole android app.
