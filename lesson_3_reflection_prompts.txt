When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When I want to share my project withe others.
  Also when a few people work on the same project in parallel.
  
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to control it and declare the commits by my own. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - are clones on GitHub , I will use it when i want to take a project from
    someone else.
    Clone - take the hole repository to a specific directory on my local computer.
    Branches - duplicate my last version and gives me the ability to change a few 
    features in parallel. In addition I will use it when I want to work with other 
    people. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    When I work on it locally I can edit it and check that the version works before 
    spread it on GitHub. In addition I can work on my project offline. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without GitHub i won’t be able to announce on a new feature or a new branch.
    The problem is that every piece of code will be shared. 
    If I don’t have Github I will always need to clone the last version from another
    server and work with it mannualy.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I want to try some new features. Also When I want to change a lot of things and 
    spread it outside to get some feedback it will be right to do it with new branch.
