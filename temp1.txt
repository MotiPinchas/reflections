What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	I would like to see the firs commit. I need it to be the start of 
	the whole project.	

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	In the staging area I prepare only the file i want to commit. Those are 
	the files that may have changed. The directory contains all the programâ€™s files.
	The repository contains only the files how were committed in the past.
	The value is that i can run and change and debug my code before I create a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organ
manually?
